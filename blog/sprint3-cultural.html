          <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence EI/EQ?</h4>
          <p><strong>Emotional Intelligence (EI) (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ)</strong> is the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s).</p>
          <p>There are three steps of Emotional Intelligence:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Attention Training</li>
            <li>Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery</li>
            <li>Creating Useful Mental Habits</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>What is Intelligence Quotient - IQ?</h4>
          <p>The <strong>Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</strong> is a measurement of your intelligence and is expressed in a number. A person's IQ can be calculated by having the person take an intelligence test. The average IQ is 100. Put simply, an IQ test measures your reasoning and problem-solving abilities.</p>

          <h4>The difference between EQ and IQ</h4>
          <p><strong>Emotional Intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ)</strong>, is defined as an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions. ... <strong>IQ, or intelligence quotient</strong>, is score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess an individual's intelligence.
          </p>

          <h4>Why is Emotional intelligence important?</h4>
          <p>As we know, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn’t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into Uni, but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your technical sprints challenge. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another.</p><br>
