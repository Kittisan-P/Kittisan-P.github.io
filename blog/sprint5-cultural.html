          <h4>Reflections</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong><br>
            Nothing extra, but perhaps strengthened areas that I was already aware of. Ego is often thought of in a pejorative sense, but I try not to have a strong ego, but rather to feel good about my achievements and encourage others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
            Values, empathy and self awareness are helpful in having a better influence and outlook on the life around you and with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
            Not a lot, most of what is mentioned is relatively normal. I also have a lot of my own ideas and methodology surrounding learning and sharing of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
            I didnt find the core learning too challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong><br>
            I believe the focus of the programming school on core learning is from the school's assumption that it will help those who maybe lack some confidence and self belief and provide them some focus and direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</strong><br>
            It has taken a lot of my time and the feeling is that my time would have been better spent concentrating on the programming instead.
          </p>

          <h4>Preparing for Bootcamp</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>
            To be a better developer, to have a mastery of several programming languages, to be an experienced web development consultant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong><br>
            Managing goalposts and tight deadlines, getting things done within timeframes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong><br>
            Same as above.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong><br>
            To be more confident with presentation skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong><br>
            To improve on my study and learning skills surrounding programming languages and to become very good with JavaScript.
          </p>
