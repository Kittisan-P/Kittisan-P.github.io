          <p>My short term goal is to be able to develop with JavaScript and work with the back and front end development. Long term is to be confident developing with several languages. Example Python, Shell and C. To be able to understand and control the entire web infrastructure environment. To understand the big picture from conceptual to delivery.</p>
         
          <p>Would like to improve my white boarding, demonstration, project and spoken presentation skills.</p>

          <p>I've had diverse cultural and social experiences, often provides me with better perception, adaptability and perseverance. Empathetic and compassionate and good listening skills are my strengths but sometimes they feel like a weakness.</p>

          <p>My expectations for the course is that the workload will be long and strenuous and I've prepared myself with this goal in mind. I plan on working and sharing with my teammates as this I hope will benefit us all. I'll frequently use the collaboration tools in a safe way for better connection between team members to help with sharing ideas, effective communication and productivity.</p>

          <p>I plan to use online resources public and commercial like Oreilly and communicate with team members, team leaders and Facilitator.</p>

          <p>I expect the facilitator team would provide Guidance with the course expectations, direction, criticism to help for my technical improvement.</p>

          <p>Ill have block-out times for daily exercise and spending time with my partner.</p>
